## Lambda operator
In lambda expressions, the lambda operator => separates the input parameters on the left side from the lambda body on the right side.
The following example uses the LINQ feature with method syntax to demonstrate the usage of lambda expressions:

```
string[] words = { "bot", "apple", "apricot" };
int minimalLength = words
  .Where(w => w.StartsWith("a"))
  .Min(w => w.Length);
Console.WriteLine(minimalLength);   // output: 5

int[] numbers = { 4, 7, 10 };
int product = numbers.Aggregate(1, (interim, next) => interim * next);
Console.WriteLine(product);   // output: 280
```

Input parameters of a lambda expression are strongly typed at compile time. When the compiler can infer the types of input parameters, like in the preceding example, you may omit type declarations. If you need to specify the type of input parameters, you must do that for each parameter, as the following example shows:

```
int[] numbers = { 4, 7, 10 };
int product = numbers.Aggregate(1, (int interim, int next) => interim * next);
Console.WriteLine(product);   // output: 280
```

The following example shows how to define a lambda expression without input parameters:

```
Func<string> greet = () => "Hello, World!";
Console.WriteLine(greet());
```

# ASP Core

## appsettings.json
What is the ASP.NET Core AppSettings.json File?
The appsettings.json file in an ASP.NET Core application is a JSON formatted file that stores configuration data. In this file, you can keep settings like connection strings, application settings, logging configuration, and anything else you want to change without recompiling your application. The settings in this file can be read at runtime and overridden by environment-specific files like appsettings.Development.json or appsettings.Production.json

The appsettings.json file is the application configuration file used to store configuration settings such as database connection strings, any application scope global variables, etc. If you open the ASP.NET Core appsettings.json file, you see the following code created by Visual Studio by default.

The appsettings.json file typically resides in the root directory of your ASP.NET Core project. You can add multiple appsettings.json files with different names, such as appsettings.development.json, appsettings.production.json, etc., to manage configuration for different environments

```
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "MyCustomKey": "MyCustomKey Value coming from appsettings.json"
}
```

Hereâ€™s what each section typically means:

* Logging: Defines the logging level for different components of the application.
* AllowedHosts: Specifies the hosts that the application will listen to.
* MyCustomSettings: A custom section that you define for your own application settings.

To access the settings in the appsettings.json file, you can use the Configuration object in the Startup class. For example:
```
public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
{
    Configuration = configuration;
}

public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }
```
You can then access the settings using the GetValue method of the Configuration object. For example:

```
string connectionString = Configuration.GetValue<string>("ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection");
```
```
public class TestModel : PageModel
{
    // requires using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    private readonly IConfiguration Configuration;

    public TestModel(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public ContentResult OnGet()
    {
        var myKeyValue = Configuration["MyKey"];
        var title = Configuration["Position:Title"];
        var name = Configuration["Position:Name"];
        var defaultLogLevel = Configuration["Logging:LogLevel:Default"];


        return Content($"MyKey value: {myKeyValue} \n" +
                       $"Title: {title} \n" +
                       $"Name: {name} \n" +
                       $"Default Log Level: {defaultLogLevel}");
    }
}
```

You can also use the appsettings.json file to store different configuration values for different environments, such as development, staging, and production. To do this, you can use the appsettings.{Environment}.json naming convention, where {Environment} is the name of the environment. For example, you might have separate appsettings.Development.json, appsettings.Staging.json, and appsettings.Production.json files for different environments. The ASP.NET Core runtime will automatically use the appropriate file based on the current environment.

# EF Core
Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, open source and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology.

EF Core can serve as an object-relational mapper (O/RM), which:

* Enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects.
* Eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that typically needs to be written.

## The model
With EF Core, data access is performed using a model. A model is made up of entity classes and a context object that represents a session with the database. The context object allows querying and saving data

EF supports the following model development approaches:

* Generate a model from an existing database.
* Hand code a model to match the database.
* Once a model is created, use EF Migrations to create a database from the model. Migrations allow evolving the database as the model changes.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace Intro;

public class BloggingContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Post> Posts { get; set; }

    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(
            @"Server=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Database=Blogging;Trusted_Connection=True");
    }
}

public class Blog
{
    public int BlogId { get; set; }
    public string Url { get; set; }
    public int Rating { get; set; }
    public List<Post> Posts { get; set; }
}

public class Post
{
    public int PostId { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Content { get; set; }

    public int BlogId { get; set; }
    public Blog Blog { get; set; }
}
```

## Querying
Instances of your entity classes are retrieved from the database using Language Integrated Query (LINQ). For more information, see Querying Data.
```
using (var db = new BloggingContext())
{
    var blogs = db.Blogs
        .Where(b => b.Rating > 3)
        .OrderBy(b => b.Url)
        .ToList();
}
```

## Saving data
Data is created, deleted, and modified in the database using instances of your entity classes. See Saving Data to learn more.
```
using (var db = new BloggingContext())
{
    var blog = new Blog { Url = "http://sample.com" };
    db.Blogs.Add(blog);
    db.SaveChanges();
}
```

## Install Entity Framework Core
To install EF Core, you install the package for the EF Core database provider(s) you want to target. This tutorial uses SQLite because it runs on all platforms that .NET supports. For a list of available providers

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
```

## Create the database
The following steps use migrations to create a database.

Run the following commands:
```
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```
This installs dotnet ef and the design package which is required to run the command on a project. The migrations command scaffolds a migration to create the initial set of tables for the model. The database update command creates the database and applies the new migration to it.

## Create, read, update & delete
Open Program.cs and replace the contents with the following code:
```
using System;
using System.Linq;

using var db = new BloggingContext();

// Note: This sample requires the database to be created before running.
Console.WriteLine($"Database path: {db.DbPath}.");

// Create
Console.WriteLine("Inserting a new blog");
db.Add(new Blog { Url = "http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet" });
db.SaveChanges();

// Read
Console.WriteLine("Querying for a blog");
var blog = db.Blogs
    .OrderBy(b => b.BlogId)
    .First();

// Update
Console.WriteLine("Updating the blog and adding a post");
blog.Url = "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet";
blog.Posts.Add(
    new Post { Title = "Hello World", Content = "I wrote an app using EF Core!" });
db.SaveChanges();

// Delete
Console.WriteLine("Delete the blog");
db.Remove(blog);
db.SaveChanges();
```

# Architecture
## Onion Architecture
What is the Onion Architecture?
The Onion architecture is a form of layered architecture and we can visualize these layers as concentric circles. Hence the name Onion architecture. The Onion architecture was first introduced by Jeffrey Palermo, to overcome the issues of the traditional N-layered architecture approach.

There are multiple ways that we can split the onion, but we are going to choose the following approach where we are going to split the architecture into 4 layers:

* Domain Layer
* Service Layer
* Infrastructure Layer
* Presentation Layer

Conceptually, we can consider that the Infrastructure and Presentation layers are on the same level of the hierarchy.

![onion](https://code-maze.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/onion_architecture.jpeg)

## Flow of Dependencies
The main idea behind the Onion architecture is the flow of dependencies, or rather how the layers interact with each other. The deeper the layer resides inside the Onion, the fewer dependencies it has

The Domain layer does not have any direct dependencies on the outside layers. It is isolated, in a way, from the outside world. The outer layers are all allowed to reference the layers that are directly below them in the hierarchy.

We can use lower layers of the Onion architecture to define contracts or interfaces. The outer layers of the architecture implement these interfaces. This means that in the Domain layer, we are not concerning ourselves with infrastructure details such as the database or external services

Using this approach, we can encapsulate all of the rich business logic in the Domain and Service layers without ever having to know any implementation details. In the Service layer, we are going to depend only on the interfaces that are defined by the layer below, which is the Domain layer.

Key Layers of Onion Architecture:
* Presentation Layer: Handles user interaction and input/output operations. It consists of user interfaces, controllers, and view models.

* Application Layer: Contains application-specific logic and serves as the entry point for the presentation layer. It encapsulates use cases, such as user management, authentication, and business workflows.

* Domain Layer: Represents the core business logic of the application. It consists of entities, aggregates, and domain services. This layer should be independent of any infrastructure or framework concerns.

* Infrastructure Layer: Provides implementations for external services and frameworks. It includes data access, third-party integrations, logging, and caching.

Domain and Application Layer will be at the center of the design. We can refer to these layers as the Core Layers. These layers will not depend on any other layers.

Domain Layer usually contains enterprise logic and entities. Application Layer would have Interfaces and types. The main difference is that The Domain Layer will have the types that are common to the entire enterprise, hence can be shared across other solutions as well. But the Application Layer has Application-specific types and interfaces. Understand?

As mentioned earlier, the Core Layers will never depend on any other layer. Therefore what we do is that we create interfaces in the Application Layer and these interfaces get implemented in the external layers. This is also known as DIP or Dependency Inversion Principle.

For example, If your application wantâ€™s to send a mail, We define an IMailService in the Application Layer and Implement it outside the Core Layers. Using DIP, it is easily possible to switch the implementations. This helps build scalable applications.

The presentation layer is where you would Ideally want to put the Project that the User can Access. This can be a WebApi, Mvc Project, etc.

The infrastructure layer is a bit more tricky. It is where you would want to add your Infrastructure. Infrastructure can be anything. Maybe an Entity Framework Core Layer for Accessing the DB, a Layer specifically made to generate JWT Tokens for Authentication or even a Hangfire Layer. You will understand more when we start Implementing Onion Architecture in ASP.NET Core WebApi Project

Under the Blank Solution, add 3 new folders.

![onion](https://www.hosting.work/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/onion-architecture-layers.png?ezimgfmt=rs:744x332/rscb5/ng:webp/ngcb4)

* Core â€“ will contain the Domain and Application layer Projects
* Infrastructure â€“ will include any projects related to the Infrastructure of the ASP.NET Core Web API (Authentication, Persistence, etc)
* Presentation â€“ The Projects that are linked to the UI or API. In our case, this folder will hold the API Project.

Layers
* Domain Layer: This layer does not depend on any other layer. This layer contains entities, enums, specifications etc.
Add repository and unit of work contracts in this layer.

* Application Layer: This layer contains business logic, services, service interfaces, request and response models.
Third party service interfaces are also defined in this layer.
This layer depends on domain layer.

* Infrastructure Layer: This layer contains database related logic (Repositories and DbContext), and third party library implementation (like logger and email service).
This implementation is based on domain and application layer.

* Presentation Layer: This layer contains Webapi or UI.
